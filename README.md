# eventApp
Web application developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Bootstrap.

This app consumes the following API's: Ticketmaster API, Spotify API and Google Maps API as well as some HTML API (Intersection Observer, Web Audio and Web Storage).

This application main goal is to help the user "Never Miss a Concert Anymore". For that, the application gathers music events around the world from Ticketmaster API, based on a specific location or date chosen by the user.

By default the application presents random music events around the world.

For each event the user is able to select the music event information by clicking the "Learn More" button or even share the event on his/her social media.

The "Learn More" button gives the user all the information about upcoming dates, a location map and a preview for the "top tracks" list on spotify.

We have developed a responsive design for this application, that responds from desktop to mobile formats. Also, we've added some aditional features, such as "scroll to top", "lazy loading" and "bookmarks".
